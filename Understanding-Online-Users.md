Eye Tracking

- Users tend to focus on the top-left corner.
- Eyes are drawn to faces specifically.
- Long fixations can be interest or confusing.
- Eye movement is scanning behavior rather than reading behavior.
- Moving back and forth between two objects could indicate comparison, confusion, or distraction.
- Important places: first place a user looks and last place a user looks.
	- First: What drew attention?
    - Last: Indicator for action.
