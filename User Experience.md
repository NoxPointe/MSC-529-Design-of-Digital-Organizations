Web Usability
=============
**Usability** is the measure of the quality of a user's experience when interacting with a product of system - whether a Web site, a software application, mobile technology, or any user-operated device.

**Usability** is a combination of factors that affect the user's experience with product or system.

- Ease of Learning
- Efficiency of Use
- Memorability
- Low Error frequency and severity
- Subjective satisfaction

**Usable** interfaces and Web sites must enable users to accomplish their tasks effectively and efficiently regardless of their physical, social, or cultural work environments.

**Usable** interfaces must also be perceived as usable by those who must use them or choose to use them.

**Usable Interfaces**

- Reflect familiar and comfortable workflows
- Support users' learning styles
- Encompass design concept that makes sense to users
- Provide a level of design consistency

**Effectiveness:** The acuracy and completeness which specified users can achieve specified goals in particular environments.

**Efficiency:** The resources expanded in relation to the accuracy and completeness of goals achieved.

**Satisfaction:** The comfort and acceptability of the work system to its users and other people affected by its use.

**Guidelines**
- Simplicity
- Speed
- Substance
- Satisfaction

Navigation
----------
Information Architecture (mental model)
- Organization, classification systems
- Differences in audience perspectives
- Politics
- Organization Schema: shared context of content items
	- eg, chronological, geographical, alphabetical, topical, task, audience, hybrid
- Organization Structures: types of relationships between content items and groups
- Use design to guide users
- Labeling should be concise, not clever, not self-centered
- Consistency
- Shortest Path
- Build context

Functionality
-------------
- Don't lead users on
- Don't overwhelm users
- Be clear about the feature and content
- Provide useful, interesting features
- Provide functional functionality

Page Layout and Content
-----------------------
- White Space is good
- Contrast is Good
- Scannability
- Short text
- Chunking
- Stationary, legibility

Web Peeves
----------
- Withholding information
- Search systems that don't work, are out of context, or irrelevant
- Nasty or Cryptic Error Messages

Considerations
--------------
- What are the goals of the organization?
- What is the vision of the site?
- What content is being presented through the site?
- What is the site image?
- What feedback is given?
- Is the organization interested in repeat visits?
- Is the site interactive? What communication channels are available?
- Are all potential audiences being addressed?
- How does this organization care about the user, or not?
